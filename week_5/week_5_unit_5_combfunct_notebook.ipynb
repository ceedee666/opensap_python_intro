    "reader to quickly understand the purpose of the Python code. In case of the previous example the combination of multiple\n",

    "what exactly happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, combining functions is a nice possibility to write very concise code. However, misusing the combination of \n",
    "functions quickly leads to unreadable Python code. When to combine functions and when not to combine functions \n",
    "is something that requires experience. In general it is better to split the Python code in to multiple lines\n",
    "by using auxillary variables then trying to write overly concise programs. Always remember: [With great power comes great responsibility]."
