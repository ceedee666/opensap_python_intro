    "When the function `play_ramones()` *(line 13)* is invoked the following happens:\n",

    "1. The function `play_music()` is invoked and the local variable `song` is passed as a parameter *(line 10)*. Through\n",
    "   this invocation the value of the parameter `song` is set to the value of the local variable `song`\n",
    "1. The `print()` function is invoked and the parameter `song` is passed as a parameter *(line 5)*\n",

    "The global variable `song` is never read or changed. The local variable `song` in the function `play_ramones()` and the\n",

    "It is important to note that, although the name *`song`* of the global variable, the local variable and the parameter is\n",
