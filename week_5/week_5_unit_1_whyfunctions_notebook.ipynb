    "# Why are functions necessary?\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the basic concepts of mathematics is that of functions. A function $ f $ assigns to each element $ x $ of\n",
    "a set $ D $ one element $ y $ of a set $ D $. The following examples show some well known functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ f (x) = x ^ 2 \\text{ for } x \\in \\mathbb{N} $\n",
    "* $ s (x, y) = x + y $ for $ x \\in \\mathbb{R} $\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is therefore clearly defined by its parameters and the associated mapping rule(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions in programming\n",
    "A function in programming is structured similarly to a function in mathematics. A function in programming\n",
    "usually consists of a *name*, a series of *parameters* and a set of *instructions*. Furthermore,\n",
    "functions usually yield some result. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of functions \n",
    "in programming are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- to structure programs\n",
    "- to make programs more readable\n",
    "- to enable reuse. \n",

    "1. The `print` function is reusable. We already used it in several of our programs\n",
    "1. The `print` function makes the program more readable \n",
