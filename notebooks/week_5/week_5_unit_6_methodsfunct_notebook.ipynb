    "# Functions vs. Methods\n",
    "You might have noticed in one of the previous units that sometimes the term *function* and sometimes the term *method*\n",
    "was used to refer to some functionality in the Python üêç standard library. This was not by mistake but a conscious usage\n",
    "of the terms to refer to different concepts. After learning about functions in Python üêç earlier, this unit highlights\n",
    "the main difference between functions and methods.\n",

    "different [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)\n",
    "have been developed. Two well know paradigms are the procedural programming paradigm and the object oriented\n",
    "programming paradigm. A detailed discussions of these paradigms is beyond the scope of this\n",
    "introductory lecture. Nevertheless the main aspects of these paradigms are described in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the procedural programming paradigm the programs are structured using procedures. These procedures contain the\n",
    "program statements. In contrast to that, the object oriented programming paradigm uses the notion of objects to\n",
