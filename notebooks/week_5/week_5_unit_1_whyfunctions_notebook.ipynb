    "\n",
    "One of the basic concepts of mathematics is that of functions. A function $ f $ assigns to each element $ x $ of\n",
    "a set $ D $ one element $ y $ of a set $ E $ ($ D $ and $ E $ can be the same like in the examples below). The following examples show some well known functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ f (x) = x ^ 2 \\text{ for } x \\in \\mathbb{N} $\n",
    "* $ s (x, y) = x + y $ for $ x \\in \\mathbb{R} $\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is therefore clearly defined by its parameters and the associated mapping rule(s).\n",

    "## Functions in programming\n",
    "A function in programming\n",
    "usually consists of a *name*, a series of *(input-)parameters* and some *statements*, which define, what the function is actually doing. Furthermore,\n",
    "functions usually yield some result. \n",

    "The main goals of functions \n",
