    "\n",
    "# Accessing and modifying list items\n",
    "Each item in a Python list is indexed. An individual item in a Python list can be accessed using its index number inside\n",
    "square brackets. The following cell gives an example of accessing the item with the index number `3` in the list\n",

    "The example shows that the item with the index `3` is the fourth item in the list. The reason is that list items are\n",
    "indexed with numbers starting from 0. This is, because programmers and computer scientist start counting with 0, not\n",
    "with 1.\n",
    "(If you want to know why, have a look on the arguments by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) \n",
    "about the [correct way of using indices](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html).)\n",
    "In the end, this leads to the unpleasant situation, that the fourth item in the list has the index `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the indices start with `0`, indices from `0` to `4` exist in a list with five elements. Additionally, each list in\n",
    "Python has a second index. In this second index items are indexed backwards starting with -1. The following table shows\n",
    "the `fruit_list` as well as the two indices on the list.\n",

    "In the following code cell, the `fruit_list` is used to show another example of accessing list items using their index.\n",
    "Note that the reverse index is particular helpful in special cases. For example, using the index `-1`, it is possible to\n",
    "access the last element of a list."
