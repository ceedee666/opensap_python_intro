    "\n",
    "Loops are needed in programming to run through a group of statements multiple times. The Python programming language has\n",
    "two types of loops: the `while` loop and the `for` loop. The `for` loop is a language element that is well suited for\n",
    "processing sequences like strings (character by character) and lists (element by element). Using a `for` loop a code\n",
    "block can be executed for every element of a list or every character of a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax\n",
    "The general syntax of the `for` loop in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for sequence-variable in sequence:\n",
    "    statement_1\n",
    "    statement_2\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    statement_n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing a sequence with a `for` loop, one element of the sequence is assigned to a *sequence-variable* in each\n",
    "iteration. For example, when a `for` loop iterates over a string, one character is processed in each loop pass. What is\n",
    "done in the processing part of the loop is determined by the statements in the *loop body*. Just like `if-elif-else`,\n",
    "the loop body is specified by indenting. All statements in the loop body are then executed. \n",
    "\n",

    "there was no such function?  \n",
    "You could simply loop through the list step by step and compare the current sequence element to the minimum you found so\n",

    "**Important:** You have to define a variable for the *current minimum* in the beginning, but what value could you choose\n",
    "for the initialisation? If you choose a value which is too small and there is no smaller value in the list, you would\n",
