The first one takes the elements of the initial list from the beginning to the end and inserts the current element into the first place of the new list. All other elements, which have been inserted before are pushed one position further. To demonstrate this behaviour, an additional `print()` has been added into the `for` loop. If you just want to print out the final solution, then comment the statement out, that means, add a `#` at the beginning of the line. Before starting the loop, the new list has to be initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second solution starts from the end of the initial list and appends the values to the new list. To do so, the method `.pop()` is helpful. It returns the last element of a list and deletes this element from the list. Again, an addition `print()` within the loop demonstrates, how the list is built up. Important: At the end of the for loop, the initial list is empty. So, if this initial list is still required, you should take a copy first.\n",
