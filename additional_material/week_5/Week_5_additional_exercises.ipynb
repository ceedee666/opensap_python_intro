    "### Exercise 1: The Answer to the Ultimate Question in Live\n",
    "Many computer scientists love the novel *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by *Douglas Adams* and especially the [The Answer to the thr Ultimate Question in Life, the Universe and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#The_Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_is_42) and even more the both genius and absurd answer 42. If you know about this famous 42, you will see it again and again in computer literature, programming examples or test input.\n",
    "\n",
    "To respect this tradition, the first exercise is quite simple: Define a function called `the_answer_to_the_ultimate_question_of_life_the_universe_and_everything()` which does not take any input parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it simply prints out the famous number 42. Don't forget to execute this function by calling it.\n"

    "\n",
    "A [Pronic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronic_number) is a number, which is a product of two consecutive integers. For example, 20 is a pronic number because `20 = 4 * 5` and 4 and 5 are consecutive numbers. Implement a function `ispronic()` which gets an integer as a parameter and checks, if the parameter is pronic. The return value of the `ispronic()` is either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",

    "- ake the square root of the parameter\n",

    "An [Abundant Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number) is a number, for which the sum of all proper divisors is greater than the number itself. For example, the number `12` is abundant as the sum of its proper divisors, `1, 2, 3, 4, 6`, is `16` and `16` is greater than `12`.\n",

    "A number is a [Narcisstic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) if it  is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. Sounds complicated? Let's give an example: `153` is narcissitic. `153` consists of `3` digits. Thus, our exponent is `3`. If we take all digits of `153` by the power of `3` and sum up the results, then we end up with 153. `1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`.\n",

    "### Exercise 6: Pascal's Triangle\n",
    "[Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) is a triangular shaped array which is often used in number theory and combinatorics. The first line of the triangular consists of one number, the second line consists of two numbers and so on. The numbers are constructed in the following way: The top number and the numbers on the left and right of each row are all `1`s. All other numbers are the sum of the two numbers next to it in the upper row. The following animated figure (linked from Wikipedia) illustrates the construction: ![Pascal's Triangle as published on Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)\n",
