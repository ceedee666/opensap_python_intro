    "This task requires the usage of `input()`. The input should be written into three variables. Finally, the output with `print()` requires the input of several parameters, that means the three variables and an additional text. The parameters have to be seperated by commas."

    "### Rectangular cuboid\n",
    "A rectangular [cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid) is a six-faced geometrical object. All angles are right angles and the edges can have three different lengths *a, b, c*. The Volume of the cuboid can be calculated with the formula:\n",

In addition, it requires some repetition, the same statement (with little variation) is used again and again. What requirements with respect to the Python can be derived due to this shortcomings?"
