    "# When to use lists, tuples and dictionaries\n",
    "So far, we have introduced three complex data types, i.e. `list`, `tuple`, \n",
    "and `dictionary`. In principal, they are interchangeable, that means, you \n",
    "could e.g. simulate every list with a dictionary. Just use the index as a key. \n",
    "Some operations will become difficult. E.g. if you delete an element in a\n",
    "list, all subsequent indices will be decreased by one. You could simulate \n",
    "that behaviour with a dictionary, however it will require a complex \n",
    "operation. The same is with lists and tuples. \n",
    "You could simulate each tuple with a list. Actually, you will gain some more \n",
    "freedom as the immutability, which is part of a `tuple` will disappear. \n",
    "So why not use a list right from the beginning, if it offers more \n",
    "possibilities? What is the advantage of having different \n",
    "complex data types? Or when should which data type be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following proposals are based on personal experiences and personal \n",
    "programming styles. They should not be taken as *the truth* but simply as a \n",
    "recommendation. These recommendation might not be shared by other programmers. \n",
    "But that is okay ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists should be used for many objects\n",
    "It is possible, to have completely different items, i.e. items with different \n",
    "data type in one list. For example `[23, \"abc\", True, (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")]` is a well \n",
    "defined list in Python. But handling these kind of lists is very difficult. If\n",
    "however all elements have the same data type, then as a programmer you can plan with this data type and use functions and methods, which are appropriate \n",
    "for the chosen data. Take the telephone list from the last notebook as an \n",
    "example. If you go through the list and process each element, then you know it \n",
    "is a telephone number (i.e. an integer). So limiting yourself in NOT having elements\n",
    "of different data types simplifies your life as a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the list `l` just contains integer. The following \n",
    "'for' loop makes use of this knowledge and divides (integer division `\\\\`) all\n",
    "values by 2. If the list would contain other data types like strings or lists,\n",
    "this operation would lead to an error.\n"

    "## Tuples should be used for complex objects\n",

    "e-mail, student-ID, course of study, address, etc. For each student, these \n",
