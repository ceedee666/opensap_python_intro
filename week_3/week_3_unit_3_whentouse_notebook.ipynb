    "# When to use lists, tuples and dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have introduced three complex data types, i.e. `list`, `tuple`, and `dictionary`. In principal, these data\n",
    "types are interchangeable.[<sup id=\"fn1-back\">1</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, every list could be simulated with a dictionary. To achieve this, one could use the index of a list item as\n",
    "the key of a dictionary. However, this approach would make some operations very difficult. E.g. if you delete an item in\n",
    "a list, all subsequent indices will be decreased by one. You could simulate that behaviour with a dictionary, however it\n",
    "will require a complex operation. The same is true for lists and tuples. You could simulate each tuple with a list.\n",
    "Actually, you will gain some more freedom as the immutability, which is part of a `tuple`, will disappear. So why not\n",
    "use a list right from the beginning, if it offers more possibilities? What is the advantage of having different complex\n",
    "data types? Or when should which data type be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following proposals are based on personal experiences and personal programming styles. They should not be taken as\n",
    "*the truth* but simply as a recommendation.\n",
    "These recommendation might not be shared by other programmers.[<sup id=\"fn2-back\">2</sup>](#fn2) But that is okay ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists should be used for many objects\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to have completely different items, i.e. items with different data types in one list. For example,\n",
    "`[23, \"abc\", True, (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")]` is a well defined list in Python. But handling these kind of lists is very\n",
    "difficult. If, however, all elements have the same data type, handling of the list is simplified. In the latter case,\n",
    "the programmer can be sure which data type is contained in the list and which functions and methods can be used. Take\n",
    "the telephone list from the previous notebook as an example. If you go through the list and process each element, then\n",
    "you know it is a telephone number (i.e. an integer). So limiting yourself in NOT having elements of different data types\n",
    "simplifies your life as a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the list `numbers` just contains integer. The following 'for' loop makes use of this knowledge\n",
    "and divides (integer division `//`) all values by 2. If the list would contain other data types like strings or lists,\n",
    "this operation would lead to an error."

    "## Tuples should be used for complex objects\n",
    "\n",
    "As argued in the first notebook of this week, tuples should be used for complex objects. I.e. for objects which require\n",
    "several attributes to be described. Take the students as an example: Each student is described by name, first name,\n",
