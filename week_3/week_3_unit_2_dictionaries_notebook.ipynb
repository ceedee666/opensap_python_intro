    "# What are dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a `list` and a `tuple` the elements are accessed using the index. This leads to the following drawback: If you want to access a specific element, you have to know at which index it is stored. Knowing the index of specific elements can become even more complicated, when other element are deleted or added. In this case the index of all following elements changes. As a consequnec accessing elements using their index can make the programming really cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing elements by name\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is solved in *dictionaries*. Dictionaries are similar to lists and tuples in that they can handle multiple elements. The big difference is: Within a dictionary the elements are not accessed by index but by *name*.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? Take as an example the telephone book. A telephone book collects lots of telephone numbers and each of this number is assigned to a name.\n",

    "| Name         | Telephone Number |\n",
    "|:-------------|-----------------:|\n",
    "| P. McCartney | 123 456          |\n",
    "| J. Lennon    | 987 654 321      |\n",

    "| R. Starr     | 777 888 32       |\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the telephone book you do **not** look for the third element but you look for the number belonging to *G. Harrison*. Actually, you want to get the number by just using the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing an element by name is what dictionaries are good for. Instead of *name* the more general term *key* is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary consists of so-called key-value pairs. Dictionaries are represented by curly brackets `{}`. The brackets\n",
    "contain the individual key-value pairs separated by commas.  Each key-value pair is represented as follows: `key : value`.   A dictionary therefore looks like this: `{key1 : value1, key2 : value2, ..., keyN : valueN}`. Have a look at the following\n",
