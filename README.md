# About

This repository contains several [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and correspondign exercises.
These notebooks are the course material for the upcoming
[openSAP](https://open.sap.com/) course [Python üêç for Beginners](https://open.sap.com/courses/python1).

## Contributing

In order to ensure that

- all output is removed from the Jupyter notebooks
- the same code formatting is used in all Jupyter notebooks

[black-nb](https://github.com/tomcatling/black-nb) is executed
using a pre-commit hook. This hook is managed using the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
framework. To activate the pre-commit hook on your development machine:

1. Install pre-commit by installing the dev dependencies from the
   [Pipfile](./Pipfile). This can, for example,
   be done by executing `pipenv install --dev`.
1. Execute `pre-commit install` to generate the pre-commit hook.
