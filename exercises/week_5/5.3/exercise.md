# Function `iseven()`
Implement the function `iseven(i)` which gets an integer as input parameter and checks, if this input is even or not. The `iseven()` will return the boolean value `True` if the value is even and `False` if the input is not even.

Implement a `for` loop which iterates over the `range(100)`. Within the `for` loop, the sequence-variable is checked with the function `iseven()`. Depending on the return value, either `x is even` or `x is not even` is printed.

Example output: 

    0 is even
    1 is not even
    2 is even
    ...

# Proposed Tests
- check if a function `iseven()` is available
- check if the function has one input parameter
- check if the function has one output parameter of data type boolean
- test the function with example values
    - 2 --> True
    - 5 --> False
- check if a for loop is available and if the function `iseven()` is used within the for loop
