# Function `is_even()`

Implement the function `is_even(number)` which gets an integer as input parameter and
checks, if this input is even or not. The `is_even()` will return the boolean value
`True` if the value is even and `False` if the input is not even.

Implement a `for` loop which iterates over the `range(100)`. Within the `for`
loop, the sequence-variable is checked with the function `is_even()`. Depending
on the return value, either `x is even` or `x is not even` is printed.

Example output:

    0 is even
    1 is not even
    2 is even
    ...
