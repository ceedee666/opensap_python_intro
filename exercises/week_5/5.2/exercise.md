# Get data from a student
Implement a function named `get_student_data()`. The function should do the following:
- Using `input()` it asks for name, first name and a student-id.
- The values are packed into a tuple.
- This tuple is given back as the return value from the function.

The function `get_student_data()` is then called in the program, the return value is assigned to a variable. Finally, output the variable using `print()`.


# Tests
- check, if function `get_student_data()` is available
- check, if function inlcudes an `input()`
- check, if the return value is a tuple consisting of three values
