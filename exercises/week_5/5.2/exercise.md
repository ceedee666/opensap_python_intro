Implement a function named `get_student_data()`. The function should do the following:

- Using `input()` it asks for name, first name and a student-id.
- The values are packed into a tuple.
- This tuple is returned from the function

The function `get_student_data()` is then called in the program, the return value is assigned to a variable.
Finally, output the variable using `print()`.
