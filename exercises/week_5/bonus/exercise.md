# Week 5 Bonus task: Prime Numbers
[Prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) are natural numbers greater than 1 which are not divisible by any number beside 1 and the number itself. In other words, the number cannot be composed as a product of two natural numbers other than 1 and the number itself. There are infinite prime numbers and the first ones are: 

   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...

## Your Task
Write a program, that gets an integer through input and creates a list containing all prime numbers until this input. To do so, two functions have to be implemented:

- The function `prime()` gets an integer as input and returns `True` if this integer is prime, and `False` if the integer is not prime. 
- The function `prime_list()` gets an integer as input and checks each number from 2 to input, if it is prime by calling the above function. If a number is prime, it is appended to a list. This list is given back as the return value of `prime_list()`.

The program finally outputs the list of all prime numbers.

## Example
Example 1:

    Up to which number do you want all prime numbers: 100
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

Example 2:

    Up to which number do you want all prime numbers: 13
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

# Proposed Tests:
- check if function `prime()` is available
- check if function `prime_list()` is available
- check if a list is given as output
- check if `prime()` contains either a for or a while loop
- check if `prime_list()` contains either a for or a while loop
- check if certain lists are created correctly
- check that if the input-number is a prime, that this prime is part of the result list
