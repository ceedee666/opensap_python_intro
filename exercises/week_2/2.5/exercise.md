# Exercise

Write a program that lets the user input a two-dimensional
[matrix](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)>).
The program should ask the user first how many rows and columns the
matrix should contain. Next, the program should ask the user for
the elements of the matrix. Finally, the program should calculate and
print the sums of the values in each row.

Below is an example execution of the program:

```
Please enter the number of rows in the matrix: 3
Please enter the number of columns in the matrix: 2
Enter the matrix values:
1
2
3
4
5
6
Sum of row: 5
Sum of row: 7
Sum of row: 9
```
