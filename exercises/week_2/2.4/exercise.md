Your are given the following list containing stock symbols, their current price
as well as the absolute price change for the previous day:


    stocks = [["SAP", 106, -3.0], ["AAPL", 165, 1.25], ["TSLA", 860, 24,2], ["ORCL", 76, -0.25], ["ZM", 114, 6.2]]


As you plan to take some of the profits, write a program that creates a list of all the stock
symbols with a change of more then +5 percent. The list should be named `sell_list`.
The list should only contain the stock symbol, not the price or the absolute change.
Print the resulting list.
