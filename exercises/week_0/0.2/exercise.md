## Introduction exercise for CodeOcean

If not done yet, open CodeOcean. Type the following line character by character into the editor.

	print("CodeOcean works fine")


### Execute the code

Execute the code by clicking the **Run** button. The window will change and the Sidebar will open. In there the
statement from above should be printed:

	CodeOcean works fine.


### Change the code

Now destroy the code by for example "forgetting" the **t** in **print**. In other words, delete the **t** from
**print**. Re-run the code. An error message should pop up, stating that *`name 'prin'`* is not defined.


### Repair the code

Now add the **t** again, that means make the **prin** a **print**. Re-run the code. Now the same output as before should
show up. Then score the code by clicking the **Score** button. The first test (*functional_tests.py*) should be failed,
stating that another output is requested. The output should be 'CodeOcean works really fine'. A second test should be
passed.


### Pass all tests

To pass the first test, add the word 'really' at the requested position into the code.
