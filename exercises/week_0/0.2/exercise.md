# Introduction exercise for CodeOcean

This exercise does not have graded points, it is just for you to become familiar and play around with the CodeOcean, 
our programming tool.

You can't break anything, so go ahead! 

## Insert code

Type the following line character by character into the editor.

    print("CodeOcean works fine") 

# Execute the code

Execute the code by clicking the **Run** button. The window will change and the Sidebar will open. In there the
statement from above should be printed:

	CodeOcean works fine

# Change the code

Now destroy the code by for example "forgetting" the **t** in **print**. In other words, delete the **t** from
**print**. Re-run the code. An error message should pop up, stating that *`name 'prin'`* is not defined.

# Repair the code

Now add the **t** again, that means make the **prin** a **print**. Re-run the code. Now the same output as before should
show up. Then score the code by clicking the **Score** button. The first test (*functional_tests.py*) should be failed,
stating that another output is requested. The output should be 'CodeOcean works really fine'. A second test should be
passed.

# Pass all tests

To pass the first test, add the word 'really' at the requested position into the code. Then re-run and re-score
the code. Now all tests should be passed.

# Request comment

If you want to, just give it a try and request a comment. Simply add a statement. Then click on your name in the 
upper right corner and check your request.
