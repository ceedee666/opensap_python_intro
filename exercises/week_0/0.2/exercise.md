# Small Exercise for CodeOcean

## Your Task
### Insert the following line of code
If not done yet, open CodeOcean. Type the following line character by character into the editor.

	print("CodeOcean works fine")
	
### Execute the code
Execute the code by clicking the run button. The window will change and the Sidebar will open. In there the statement from above should be printed: "CodeOcean works fine".

### Change the code 
Now destroy the code by for example "forgetting" the **t** in **print**. In other words, delete the **t** from **print**. Re-run the code. An error message should pop up, stating that *name 'prin' is not defined.

### Repair the code
Now add the **t** again, that means make the **prin** a **print**. Re-run the code. Now the same output as before should show up. Then score the code by clicking the score button. The first test (*functional_tests.py*) should be failed, stating that another output is requested. The output should be 'CodeOcean works really fine'. A second test should be passed. Maybe, the linter is not happy and requests a **final newline**.

### Pass all tests
To pass the first test, add the word 'really' at the requested position into the code. If the **newline** was missing, add a return at the end of the single line. A new empty line should be available. Now re-run and re-score the code.



# Planned Tests:
## Test one
Checks, if the output is "CodeOcean works really fine"

## Test two
Checks, if the file contains a print
