Write a Python program that asks the user to enter:

- A name
- A start city
- A destination city and
- A means of transportation

The program should then print that the _name_ wants to travel from _start_ to _destination_
by _means of transportation_.
Below is an example execution of the program:

    Please enter a name: Christian
    Please enter a start: Aachen
    Please enter a destination: Berlin
    Please enter a means of transportation: Train

    Christian wants to travel from Aachen to Berlin by Train
