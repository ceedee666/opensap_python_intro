[Triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle#Types_of_triangle) can be classified based on their angels.

- A right triangle has one angle of 90째
- A obtuse triangle has one angle of more then 90째
- A triangle is acute if all three angels are less then 90째.

Write a program that asks the user for the value of three angels in degrees. First check if the entered values are valid.
The values are only valid if their sum is 180째. If the entered values are valid classify the triangle as right, acute or obtuse.

Below is an example execution of the program:


    Please enter the first angle: 60
    Please enter the second angle: 60
    Please enter the third angle: 100

    The entered values are not valid.


Here is another example execution of the program:

    Please enter the first angle: 60
    Please enter the second angle: 30
    Please enter the third angle: 90

    The triangle is a right triangle.
