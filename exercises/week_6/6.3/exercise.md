# Unit 3 Exercise - Gauss Distribution

Import the `random` library and have a look at the function `gauss()` which
gives back a random float number. Which parameters are required?
Write a function `gaussian_distribution()` that returns a list of 1000
random nummers with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. Invoke this function.

For the resulting list calculate and print the mean
and the standard deviation using the respectice functions from the `statistics` library.
Re-run the program and observe, if the values change.
