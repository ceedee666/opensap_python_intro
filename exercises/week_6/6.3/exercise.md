# Unit 3 Exercise - Gauss Distribution
Import the `random` library and have a look at the function `gauss()` which gives back a random float number. Which parameters are required? Create 1000 random nummers with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10 and store these number in a list.
From the `statistics` library take the respective functions and check the mean and the standard deviation of the list. Re-run the program and observe, if the values change.

# Proposed Tests
- check, if random is imported
- check, if statistics is imported
- check, if the functions `gauss()`, `mean()` and `stdev()` are used.
