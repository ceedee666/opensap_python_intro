# Accessing the Apple iTunes Search Service

In this assignment you are going to build a Python program to access the
[Apple iTunes Search Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html).
This service can be used to search information about musicians, albums, songs and so on.

Using the following URL a search for the term _ramones_ and for the entity type
_album_ is performed:
[https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=ramones&entity=album](https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=ramones&entity=album)

Other possible entity types are musicArtist, musicTrack or song. Below is an (abbreviated)
example result of the service:

```json
{
  "resultCount": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "wrapperType": "collection",
      "collectionType": "Album",
      "artistId": 60715,
      "amgArtistId": 5223,
      "artistName": "Ramones",
      "collectionName": "Ramones",
      "collectionPrice": 9.99,
      "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit",
      "trackCount": 14,
      "copyright": "â„— 1976 Sire Records. Marketed by Rhino Entertainment Company, a Warner Music Group Company.",
      "country": "USA",
      "currency": "USD",
      "releaseDate": "1976-04-23T08:00:00Z",
      "primaryGenreName": "Punk"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response consist of one result (`resultCount` is 1). This result is the album
"Ramones" (element `collectionName`) by the artist "Ramones" (element `artistName`)
The response is in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.

In order to perform a search with the search service the [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
library is used to perform a Get-request. Using the method `json()` of the Requests
library can be used to mapped the response from JASON to Python data types `dict` and `list`.

## Assignment

Write a program that asks the user for a search term. Perform a search using the iTunes search service
for the entity type album. For each result print the artist name, the album name, the genre name and the track count.
