    "# Week 3 Bonus - Caesar Cipher more sophisiticated\n",
    "The bonus exercise builds upon the assignment of this week. Here is the description of this weeks exercise again:\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is a simple encryption technique. The encryption using a\n",
    "Ceasar cipher replaces a letter in the plain text with a letter that is a fixed number down in the alphabet. For\n",
    "example, with a shift of 5 the following substitutions would take place:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a → f\n",
    "- b → g\n",
    "- c → h\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- v → a\n",
    "- w → b\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- z → e\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this substitutions, a plain text can be encrypted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plaintext: programming python is fun!\n",
    "- Encrypted text: uwtlwfrrnsl udymts nx kzs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for the bonus exercise is the implementation of a Caesar cipher with a variable shift. The program should ask\n",
    "the user for a number of characters for the shift first. Next the program should ask the user for a plain text sentence\n",
    "and print the encrypted text. Here is an example execution of the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please enter the number of places to shift: 5\n",
    "    Please enter a sentence: python is fun!\n",
    "    The encrypted sentence is: udymts nx kzs!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another execution of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please enter the number of places to shift: 10\n",
    "    Please enter a sentence: python is fun!\n",
    "    The encrypted sentence is: zidryx sc pex!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet another one\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please enter the number of places to shift: 0\n",
    "    Please enter a sentence: python is fun!\n",
    "    The encrypted sentence is: python is fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should check that only numbers between 0 and 25 are entered for the number of places to shift!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please enter the number of places to shift: 60\n",
    "    You need to enter a number between 0 and 25!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The simple solution using a dictionary will not work for this exercise. Instead you need to build the substitution\n",
    "   dynamically. This can be done using the\n",
    "   [find method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=index#str.find) and some calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    abc = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw\"\n",
    "    char_index = abc.find(\"f\")\n",
    "    encrypted_char = abc[char_index + 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Note that in the example above there will be an error if char_index +5 is larger then 25. You need to use the modulo\n",
    "   (%) operator to take care of this situation.\n",
    "1. In order to check if the user entered a number, the method\n",
    "   [isdecimal()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=isdigit#str.isdecimal) can be used.\n",
    "1. To avoid handling upper and lower case letters it is best to first convert the user input to lower case. After that\n",
    "   you only need to take into account lower case letters. A string can be converted into lower case using the .lower()\n",
    "   method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the following example\n",
