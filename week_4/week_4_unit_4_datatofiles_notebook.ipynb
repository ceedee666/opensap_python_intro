    "Create a program (similar to the previous one) that writes all letters from a-z into one line of a file each. Note: The function `chr()` converts a number into a letter. Here, the number 97 corresponds to an a, the number 98 to a b, and so on. (see next code cell). Behind this assignment is the ASCII table. ASCII is a coding standard that assigns the characters and commands of a typewriter to bit combinations. The bit combinations are usually specified as numbers from 0 to 127. See also [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange#ASCII-Tabelle)."
